<h1> An Elegant CSS Style </h1>

<h2> Introduction </h2>

This file is a demo of <i>eluhgunt.css</i>, a CSS stylesheet for publishing
nice-looking essays. It's intended to be pretty minimalistic and use some
nice fonts. It works on mobile as well as desktop, and will scale down
appropriately depending on the width of the display.

<h3> A level three header </h3>

This is what some text following an H3 looks like.

<h4> A level four header </h4>

This is what some text following an H4 looks like.

<h5> A level five header </h5>

This is what some text following an H5 looks like.

<h2> Examples of illustrations </h2>

The following is an example of an illustration image.

<img src="https://soulsphere.org/img/blog/doom-e1m1/E1M1-1.png"
     class="illustration">

Here's some text following on from the illustration and making some apposite
observations about the image. What an interesting image to use as an
illustration. I guess I'll pat myself on the back.

<p>

We can also use other elements like iframes as illustrations.

<iframe class="illustration" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z5pATG031x4"
	frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This is my own funny video. Ho ho ho, how very clever of me.
By the way, did you like the horizontal rule that appeared before this section?
I think it looks pretty nice.

<h2> Typical stylings </h2>

You probably want to see what the usual HTML elements look like, so here's a
brief demo.
<p>

We just started a new paragraph. Here's a bullet point list:

<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://soulsphere.org/you-never-visited-this">This is what a link</a>
looks like next to some ordinary text. Hover over it if you're not quite
convinced it's really a link,
<a href="">here's another link</a> you have probably already visited.
<li>
<b> We've got bold text.</b> Just keep on reading because you certainly know
that there's another great more example coming.
<li>
<i> We've got italic text.</i> Wow! Those are real italics!
<li>
<tt>Monospaced text</tt>, important for when we're naming all those functions
in programming essays.
</ul>

Let's remind ourselves of the three laws of robotics as an excuse to
demonstrate numbered lists as well.
<ol>
<li> A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human
being to come to harm.
<li> A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such
orders would conflict with the First Law.
<li> A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not
conflict with the First or Second Laws.
</ol>

And, as Commander Data once said:

<blockquote>
Early bird [gets the worm]? I believe Commander Shelby erred. There is
no evidence of avian or crawling vermicular lifeforms on Jure IV.
</blockquote>

Here's a table with some information in it:

<table>
<tr>
<th> City
<th> Longitude
<th> Latitude
<th> Time Zone
<th> Known For
<tr>
<td> London
<td> 51°30′N
<td> 0°7′W
<td> UTC / UTC+1
<td> Palace of Westminster; Westminster Abbey
<tr>
<td> Boston
<td> 42°21′N
<td> 71°03′W
<td> UTC-5 / UTC-4
<td> American Revolution; Harvard University &amp; MIT
<tr>
<td> Naples
<td> 40°50′N
<td> 14°15′E
<td> UTC+1 / UTC+2
<td> Ruins of Pompeii; Pizza
</table>

As you can see the table looks nice.
<p>
Also, long words like
Lopadotemachoselachogaleokranioleipsanodrimhypotrimmatosilphioparaomelitokatakechymenokichlepikossyphophattoperisteralektryonoptekephalliokigklopeleiolagoiosiraiobaphetraganopterygon
will be broken if it's strictly necessary.

<h2> Source code formatting </h2>

We have a nice font configured so that we get nice looking source code when
we use the <i>pre</i> element.

<pre>
//
// Fixed point, 32bit as 16.16.
//
#define FRACBITS		16
#define FRACUNIT		(1&lt;&lt;FRACBITS)

typedef int fixed_t;

fixed_t FixedMul	(fixed_t a, fixed_t b);
fixed_t FixedDiv	(fixed_t a, fixed_t b);
</pre>

Isn't that nice? Now we can provide some fascinating commentary on this piece
of source code that I've just quoted. But I'm too lazy to.
