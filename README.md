*Eluhgunt* is a CSS stylesheet designed intended for publishing
nice-looking essays. It's intended to be pretty minimalistic and use
some nice fonts.

Features include:

* Styling for all the most common HTML elements: `h1` to `h6`, `ol`,
  `ul`, `table`, `pre` and `tt`, `blockquote`, `hr`, etc.
* Works on mobile as well as desktop, and will scale down appropriately
  depending on the width of the display.
* Nice selection of freely redistributable fonts.
* Dark theme support
